# UX Design of Public Experiences

## DH150 Assignment01: Heuristic Evaluation of "Public" Websites by Avery Edson

### Overall Motivation:

When I think of public entities, the US public education system immediately comes to mind. It's run by state/local governments, funded by community taxpayers, and attended by the nation's youth; it concerns people as a whole. The term itself, "public" education, implies it is made available to all. And so, given the project theme of "public", I have first decided to focus on public education, specifically my own. Thus, the first website I have chosen is the website for the public high school I attended, McLean High School. 

Throughout my life, the public resource I have taken advantage of the most would have to be libraries. Public libraries are accessible by the general public, funded by public sources. They provide the community greatly with information, services, and technology, whether it be for recreational or educational purposes. And so, for this project I will revisit the library I frequented the most while in high school. The second website I have chosen is the website for the Dolley Madison Library.

### Website 1: McLean High School (MHS)
https://mcleanhs.fcps.edu/

#### Initial Evaluation:
The site seems to pack in a lot of useful information regarding the school, anticipating many users' queries. In this sense, the site presents a good understanding of what content its users desire, however, there is a great lack of organization. For example, the global navigation menu in the header is quite straightforward, but once you click on it, the site takes you to a new page where the subpages are listed, which then take you to subsquent pages with more subpages. This is tedious to navigate through, and requires the user to maneuver back and forth between pages in search of the desired one. Additionally, there are navigation links on the homepage that seem to be a random assortment of topics. I am assuming such are common links used by the daily user, however, this would certainly confuse a new user. The biggest issue with this site is it lacks the organization/consolidation of information, speficically regarding its subpages, which reduces user accessibility. 

### Website 2: Dolley Madison Library

### Heuristic Evaluation:

#### 1: Visibility of system status
##### MHS
+Certain tabs have graphics that will move when hovering over them, informing the user that the site is registering their movements.

+The search results state the number of results there are at the top of the page, as well which results are displayed on the current page. 

+When you scroll down a page, a grey circle with an arrow appears in the bottom right hand corner, allowing the user to click it to return to the top. This indicates to the user they have left the top of the page. It disappears once they return to the top of the page.

-Only some navigation links will be highlighted/indicated when hovering over them. This allows the user to know they may interact with the link, however, consistency is required.

-There is no visualization that relays to the user a page is loading.

#### 2: Match between system and the real world
##### MHS
+Familiar icons and infographics contribute to user understanding. 

+Navigation links include common phrases that are clear and concise, improving the user's understanding of what to expect if they click it.

-The "Features" page relays what is going on lately at the school like short news highlights. The term "features" does not accurately represent this.

-System-oriented terms in the homepage will confuse new users.

-Titles of the site and subpages are found on the right side of the page. This is illogical as users are accustomed to reading from left to right.

#### 3: User control and freedom
##### MHS
+The site allows the user to access and exit the search bar without leaving the page they were previously on. 

+The user can edit the search query at the top of their search results.

+The site allows the user to access and exit the "Full Menu" navigation bar without losing the page they were on. The user can also maneuver back and forth between subpage headers in the navigation bar using a back arrow.

-When changing the language, the site changes everything including the language options for changing the language. For example, I changed the language to Arabic and wanted to change it back to English, however, I could not distinguish which language was English in the dropdown list because all the options were written in Arabic. The site does not support undoing a change of language easily.

#### 4: Consistency and standards
##### MHS
+Consistent typography.

-Inconsistent page displays for the pages linked in the header navigation bar.

-There is a difference in the navigation headings of the main menu displayed on the homepage and of the extended "Full Menu". This could confuse users as to which links lead to which pages.

-There is a difference in box colors in the announcements sections, leaving users to wonder whether this has any meaning.
##### Dolley Madison 

#### 5: Error prevention
##### MHS
+An error message pops up when attempting to submit a contact form with incorrect information.

+The site checks with the user if they are sure they wish to leave the page. This prevents the user from losing any information they might not want tot delete.

-The site does not inform or ask the user if they are sure they wish to leave the site when clicking links that redirect to an external site.
##### Dolley Madison 

#### 6: Recognition rather than recall
##### MHS
+The search bar suggests search options that the user has previously searched, reminding the user what they had searched before.

+When navigating through the site, the header (within the "Full Menu") that the user's current page falls under is highlighted. This allows the user to remember how they navigated the site to reach the page they are on.
##### Dolley Madison 

#### 7: Flexibility and efficiency of use
##### MHS
+/-On the homepage, there are additional navigation links presented within a subheader. "FCPS 24-7 Learning" is the school's system CCLE, and so I assume these are frequently visited links that are presented on the homepage for quick access. This is convenient for the expert user who understands what these system-oriented terms are. This may, however, confuse inexperienced users who don't understand what these links are.
