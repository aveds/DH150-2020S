## DH150 Assignment01: Heuristic Evaluation of "Public" Websites by Avery Edson

### Overall Motivation and Description:

When I think of public entities, the US public education system immediately comes to mind. It's run by state/local governments, funded by community taxpayers, and attended by the nation's youth; it concerns people as a whole. The term itself, "public" education, implies it is made available to all. And so, given the project theme of "public", I have first decided to focus on public education, specifically my own. Thus, the first website I have chosen is the website for the public high school I attended, McLean High School. 

Throughout my life, the public resource I have taken advantage of the most would have to be libraries. Public libraries are accessible by the general public, funded by public sources. They provide the community greatly with information, services, and technology, whether it be for recreational or educational purposes. And so, for this project I will revisit the library I frequented the most while in high school. The second website I have chosen is the website for the Dolley Madison Library.
