## DH150 Assignment01: Heuristic Evaluation of "Public" Websites by Avery Edson

### Overall Motivation and Description:

When I think of public entities, the US public education system immediately comes to mind. It's run by state/local governments, funded by community taxpayers, and attended by the nation's youth; it concerns people as a whole. The term itself, "public" education, implies it is made available to all. And so, given the project theme of "public", I have decided to focus on public education, specifically my own. The first website I have chosen is the website for the public high school I attended, McLean High School. The second is the website for the public university I currently attend, the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA).

### Website 1: McLean High School
