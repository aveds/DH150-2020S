        <h1> Welcome to the Santa Monica Public Library Website </h1>

        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <p>This project focuses on a human-centered redesign of the Santa Monica Public Library website. Working within a given project theme of "public", I chose to redesign a library website because libraries have been a great resource to many, including myself. They provide the community greatly with information, services, and technology, whether it be for recreational or educational purposes. Because libraries have such a wide-ranging user group, it is important that their website design is clear and logical to follow. I will reflect this notion within my redesign of the Santa Monica Public Library (SMPL) website, a public library I have frequented while living in Los Angeles.</p>

        <h3>Design Statement</h3>
        <p>Libraries have much to offer, and as a result their websites can often overwhelm users with information. This is the case for the Santa Monica Public Library (SMPL) website. The SMPL website has tons of information and resources crammed into it. This would be fine if the website was thouroughly organized, however, it is unclear where and what information can be found on the website's pages. This and the website's overuse of color does not make it user-friendly. I think it's important to resolve these issues so that users can more easily find what they are looking for.</p>

        <h3>Competitor Analysis</h3>
        <p>To understand what the existing SMPL website does and doesn't do well in terms of its usability, I performed a heuristic evaluation of it as well as a usability test. Based on what I found within the heuristic evaluation, I created tasks for the usability test to assess certain aspects of the site. The purpose of the usability test (UT) is to uncover usability issues with the design of the SMPL website, so that I can make improvements. Through UT, we begin to understand how real users interact with a product, and are therefore able to improve its design. One of the aspects I wanted to test was how certain inconsistencies affect the usability of the site, specifically the listing of the library’s branches on the homepage. And so, the first task I included in the UT was to search the library’s basic information, which can be found using the provided information on the homepage. Depending on how the user goes about completing the first task, this can also test the usability of the site’s tabs and whether their titles are representative of what their pages contain. The next feature I wanted to test was the usability of the library’s online catalog. I assume most users visit the library’s website with the purpose of searching the library catalog, and so it is of high priority to optimize its usability. Thus, the second task requires the user to search and to modify a search within the library catalog. The third aspect I wanted to test was the site’s layout of information. Specifically, whether it was clear that certain information would be found under certain tabs and whether each page layout was structured to be understood by the user. And so, the third task asks the user to search for information within the library’s site, allowing myself to observe how they interact with the site’s tabs/pages.</p>

        <h3>User Research</h3>
        <p>To understand users' contexts when using the SMPL website, I conducted a contextual inquiry interview. This entails asking the user a set of constructed questions, allowing them to elaborate, and observing/questioning them while they work in their own environments.</p>

        <h3>UX Storytelling</h3>
        <p>The purpose of UX storytelling is to understand the user; it allows design teams to gain insights into their users’ thoughts, behaviors, actions, and contexts. In addition to this, it allows teams to connect quickly, to establish an agreed upon perception of their user, so that they may work effectively to design a cohesive product. Here, I have created personas and scenarios to base the redesign of the SMPL website on.</p>

        <h3>Low-fidelity prototype</h3>
        <p>The purpose of this low-fidelity prototype is to translate the concepts I have for certain features into tangible 2D visuals and to test their functionality. I can then go through the iterative process of having users test the low-fidelity prototype and of making the necessary revisions, before moving on to the high-fidelity prototype.</p>

        <h3>High-fidelity prototype</h3>
        <p>Based on my findings from a heuristic evaluation and from the user research of the current library website, I have drafted my own design. The high-fidelity prototype allows me to tangibly realize my designs, as well as serves as a preliminary mock-up which users can more realistically interact with. I can then test my website design with real users, evaluating all possible aspects, inlcuding interactions, user flows, and color schemes.</p>

        <p>I conducted an impression test and a cognitive walkthrough using the high-fidelity prototype to gather more insights and I conducted a color-contrast check to assess the accessibility provided by the color scheme I chose. </p>

        <h3>Conclusion</h3>
        <p>This redesign is the first UX design project I’ve done, and so it has been a great introduction to what the design process entails: research, ideation, creation, revision, and iteration, all while keeping humans/users at the center of focus. In regards to the SMPL website, I have learned that the main issue users have with its existing website is its disorganization. For example, tabs are unclearly titled leaving users confused about what to expect from certain interactions and where to find the information they desire. User research furthered my understanding of this issue, as well as provided insights into the users’ contexts and what improvements users would want to see. I found this to be a crucial part of the process because the understanding developed in conversation with users serves as the foundation for the rest of the design process: for building personas and scenarios, for designing the wireframes, etc. I learned that the design process is not linear, it is more often cyclical and not even entirely so as you are constantly jumping between stages: from development to testing and back to development and so on. In conclusion, I redesigned parts of the SMPL website to allow users to complete specific tasks more easily (or so I think so). I am sure that further improvements can and should be made and that this is by no means the best version of the website, but it is a start. Good design takes many forms, and that is something I have learned by going through multiple iterations of this redesign.</p>
