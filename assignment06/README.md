# UX Design of a Public Library Website

## DH150: Assignment06: Low-Fidelity Prototyping by Avery Edson

---

#### Description of project:

For this project, I have chosen to redesign the Santa Monica Public Library website. The Santa Monica Public Library consists of one main library and four additional library branches, all located in Santa Monica, California. Given that it is for the public, the Santa Monica library serves many purposes for a wide range of users. Rather than try to incorporate them all within my redesign, I have chosen to focus on the most used website features across these user groups for the purposes of this project.
Given the current pandemic, it was difficult to conduct extensive user research to properly understand which of the library's website features are the most used. Based on the research I was able to gather and on my own previous experiences, I concluded that many users visit the library website to search within the library's catalog. This is the first feature I will focus on. Many users then visit the website to find out information regarding the library, as in what is its hours, what services does it provide, what programs does it host, etc. I understand this is quite a vague statement, but again, I am trying to encapsulate as many users within my understanding of the website, and it seems most users intend to read information when visiting the website.  Thus, the second feature I will focus on is the organization of information across the website's pages, including their titles and content. Additionally, to find the information they are looking for, many users will defer to a site's search function, rather than exploring each tab. And so, the third aspect I will focus on is the site's search feature.

I created three personas, one based on the user research I conducted and two based on my own perceptions. I understand this is flawed, but again, I was unable to conduct extensive user research given the circumstances. 

The first persona is a young female college student, Kathy Chen. Kathy attends UCLA and is very busy, so she doesn't usually spend much time at public libraries off-campus. Plus, she has many resources available to her through ULCA already. When she does want to use the public library, however, she expects to find out information on its website pretty immediately, especially because she considers herself to be techonologically savvy. 

The second persona is a 38 year old man looking to make a career change, I've named him Chris Hayes. Unlike Kathy, Chris does not have the resources an institution provides, and so the public library proves to be very useful to him. Chris wants to become a realtor, and thus wants to gather as much reading material on real estate as he can so that he can prepare himself for this change. Chris also has two kids. Luckily the Santa Monica Public Library has a kids section; he could complete his studies at the library while still keeping his kids entertained.

The third persona is an elderly woman hoping to gain  computer skills, her name is Amy Ngai. Just like Chris, she doesn't have access to the resources an institution provides. Amy is tired of having to rely on her kids for help when she wants to send an emails, and so she hopes the Santa Monica Public Library will be able to help her with her goals. 

The scenarios I've created for these personas incoporates the features I have chosen to focus on: the library catalog, organization of information within the site, and the site's search function. The scenarios are:

- Kathy wants to reserve a study room for her and her friends, and will maneuver through the website to find information on how to reserve one.
- Chris wants to find the best reading material on real estate, and so will browse within the library's catalog.
- Amy wants to find out whether the library offers computer courses or not, so she searches "computer courses" within the site (or she could also elect to naviagte through the site's tabs to find out this information)

The purpose of this low-fidelity prototyping is to translate the concepts I have for these features into tangible 2D visuals and to test their functionality. I can then go through the iterative process of having users test the low-fidelity prototype and making the necessary revisions, before moving on to high-fidelity prototyping.

### Reflection:

Once I identified the features I wanted to test and established which tasks I would ask the user to complete, I sketched the necessary wireframes. I found myself developing the wireframes as if I were the user, consisently asking myself questions. What would I want to have the ability to do here? How would I interpret this normally? Is this presentation clear and logical? These initial wireframes served as a starting point; they present my basic ideas for the site. I then created more detailed wireframes within my wireflow as I gained a better understanding of what my system needs to entail. I found this part of the process to be quite enjoyable, probably because I generally enjoy sketching. Something I think I could improve on within my wireflow is the organization of the frames. I sketched certain related frames distant from one another within the page, and so the arrows that relate them within the wireflow are unnecessarily long, spanning the entire page. This and the fact that many of the arrows overlap each other can make the wireflow dificult to follow. In the future, it would make sense to have the flow in mind while sketching the wireframes. I also found that within low-fidelity prototyping, it is necessary to write out all types of interactive elements. I did this for the features I thought required additional information, however, there were still some the user was uncertain about. Obviously, it's different from a user testing the design on a screen as the screen actually responds, allowing the user to uncover interactive features quite easily on their own. Because this is a handwritten low-fidelity prototype, written descriptions should be provided for all intended interactive elements.

The biggest issue the user had with the prototype was with the tabs on the homepage, specifically the titles of these tabs and understanding what sorts of information they would contain based on the title. The user stated that, generally within a library website, they would exhaust the tabs to look for information rather than using the search bar, and so the organization/titles of these tabs is quite important. I will admit I struggled creating tab names to encompass all the information the Santa Monica Public Library provides within its website, and perhaps didn't put in enough time/thought before sketching the prototype. I would like to revise these tab and page titles and might make use of card-sorting to do this.
