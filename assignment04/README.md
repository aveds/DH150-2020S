# UX Design of a Public Library Website 

## DH150 Assignment04: Contextual Inquiry by Avery Edson

### 1) Specify the main design challenge

#### What is the main activity your project would support the users in accomplishing?
This project will support users in being able to search through the library’s catalog to see what items the library has available to check out. This allows users to access resources for educational, informational, and personal development purposes.

#### What is the basic need involved for that activity? 
This activity fulfills the user’s basic need for safety as the resources available can provide them with the information to attain emotional, financial, social stability (e.g. employment, social welfare). This activity can additionally fulfill the user’s esteem and self-actualization needs as these resources can be used to achieve mastery and personal growth.

#### What is(are) the traditional/current solution(s) to satisfy the needs?
Current solutions to satisfy this need to access educational and informational resources are largely provided through the education system. Schools and universities, both public and private, provide their students with access to additional resources. However, such education, especially the university-level, is inaccessible to many because of the hefty expense. Plenty of these resources can be found on the internet. Some are publicly available for free, but many also require a purchase or a subscription. People may also access these resources at bookstores, however, this requires a purchase if the user wishes to take items with them.

#### What is(are) the limitation(s) that possibly would be improved with (digital) technology?
Certain limitations for accessing such resources include financial ability. Improvements have been made to curb financial barriers using technology such as making these resources available for free online. However, many books and videos still require purchase, which is where the public library proves to be a useful asset. Yet, the library does have a limited collection, and so it would be useful to develop a platform through which users could easily donate or requests additional resources if they are unable to find it within the library’s catalog/site.

### 2) Specify target users

#### What are the characteristics of users? (ex. demographics, preference, expertise) 
Demographic: people living in the Los Angeles area, specifically closer to Santa Monica, more likely adults who do not have the access educational institutions provide

Preferences: users are able to easily search using the catalog and to access the desired information through the library

Expertise: no expertise is required to use this application

#### Where would the users do that activity? (i.e., context of use)
Users will most likely search through the library’s catalog from any location with Wi-Fi connection that is not the library itself. I would assume most users would do this from their homes, however, it really can be any location in which users would use their laptop. Users may do this activity at the library itself, however, I believe most libraries have specific desktops that solely access the catalog, and so the user would not have to access it through the library’s website, which is what I intend to redesign. 

#### What would the users do to complete that activity? (e.g., goal, operation, method, action)
To find out what resources the library has available, users would search through the library’s catalog or call the library and ask an employee. 

### 3) Describe research method and plan
The research method I employed is contextual inquiry. This method includes observation, participation, and an interview. The research materials used can be found in the next section.
