# UX Design of a Public Library Website 

## DH150 Assignment04: Contextual Inquiry by Avery Edson

### 1) Specify the main design challenge

#### What is the main activity your project would support the users in accomplishing?
This project will support users in being able to search through the library’s catalog to see what items the library has available to check out. This allows users to access resources for educational, informational, and personal development purposes.

#### What is the basic need involved for that activity? 
This activity fulfills the user’s basic need for safety as the resources available can provide them with the information to attain emotional, financial, social stability (e.g. employment, social welfare). This activity can additionally fulfill the user’s esteem and self-actualization needs as these resources can be used to achieve mastery and personal growth.

#### What is(are) the traditional/current solution(s) to satisfy the needs?
Current solutions to satisfy this need to access educational and informational resources are largely provided through the education system. Schools and universities, both public and private, provide their students with access to additional resources. However, such education, especially the university-level, is inaccessible to many because of the hefty expense. Plenty of these resources can be found on the internet. Some are publicly available for free, but many also require a purchase or a subscription. People may also access these resources at bookstores, however, this requires a purchase if the user wishes to take items with them.

#### What is(are) the limitation(s) that possibly would be improved with (digital) technology?
Certain limitations for accessing such resources include financial ability. Improvements have been made to curb financial barriers using technology such as making these resources available for free online. However, many books and videos still require purchase, which is where the public library proves to be a useful asset. Yet, the library does have a limited collection, and so it would be useful to develop a platform through which users could easily donate or requests additional resources if they are unable to find it within the library’s catalog/site.

### 2) Specify target users

#### What are the characteristics of users? (ex. demographics, preference, expertise) 
Demographic: people living in the Los Angeles area, specifically closer to Santa Monica, more likely adults who do not have the access educational institutions provide

Preferences: users are able to easily search using the catalog and to access the desired information through the library

Expertise: no expertise is required to use this application

#### Where would the users do that activity? (i.e., context of use)
Users will most likely search through the library’s catalog from any location with Wi-Fi connection that is not the library itself. I would assume most users would do this from their homes, however, it really can be any location in which users would use their laptop. Users may do this activity at the library itself, however, I believe most libraries have specific desktops that solely access the catalog, and so the user would not have to access it through the library’s website, which is what I intend to redesign. 

#### What would the users do to complete that activity? (e.g., goal, operation, method, action)
To find out what resources the library has available, users would search through the library’s catalog or call the library and ask an employee. 

### 3) Describe research method and plan
The research method I employed is contextual inquiry. This method includes observation, participation, and an interview. The research materials used can be found in the next section.

### 4) Research materials:

#### Contextual Inquiry Guide
Please find the **script** for this interview [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1eDBNlqgkri3PVL32RvST1tFikwtDXpVBQSXWEW9VVZo/edit?usp=sharing), with an introduction, goals, and contextual questions.

#### User Data
Please find the **recording** of the interview [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1WFmHFBdvqGjrx02sZok4uWyatxnvzWwp/view?usp=sharing) and the **transcription** of the interview [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1h5HI9TaPO7ZF6qi10AxLUBNqHVPe3Hsm/view?usp=sharing).

#### Interesting quotes from the interview:

* **The user notices the books available at the Santa Monica Public Library are more pleasure reading.** "If I'm writing the paper on it. Like a paper for a class, I probably wouldn't be able to use any of these books because they're like lifestyle but okay. I wonder if I go here. Hmm, I guess the Santa Monica libraries more for like pleasure reading."

* **The user notices the library catalog does not perform well for specific search topics.** "it seems like you have to keep it broad to get a lot of options, because if I put something into specific I only get like one option. But then, it's hard to narrow down from a broad topic."

* **The user states their main struggle with searching for resources stems from the overabundance of options.** "There's so much content, especially with using like online forums that can pull from so many places that it's hard to know what is the best resource. What helps with that being able to, I think when search engines have like very specific like here's my keyword here's my like secondary keyword here's my like, yeah, like I think some websites are better than this one."

### 5) Reflection

Throughout this process, I found it difficult to simultaneously conduct each aspect of the interview on my own. It took me a few seconds to completely set up in front of my participant. This included setting up the transcription app, the video-recording system, and the two separate screens: one for the script and one for the participant to use. The transcription and video-recording tools were also not extremely accurate. At some points, the resulting transcription was incoherent, requiring a lot of editing and the recording lagged as well. I also found it difficult to take notes while conducting the interview. I felt that by taking notes, I was interrupting the flow of discussion between myself and the participant and may have caused the participant to feel ignored. In the future, I will clarify within the introduction that this is not the case. That said, the discussion-nature of the interview did provide a more cohesive understanding of the user’s experiences and thoughts. Based on the participant’s response, I found myself asking follow-up questions I had not included in the original script, questions that I thought would provide useful insights. The script was certainly a nice guide, however, I did not follow it word for word as I spoke more so to maintain the flow of the conversation. Having done this first interview will certainly help me to revise the script as I now know what to expect and what it is exactly I want to ask of the user. This assignment, or rather research, seems to vary greatly based on what website/app/activity is being tested, there doesn’t seem to be one strict template to follow. This assingment has helped me to understand what a comprehensive project consists of -- that being, an estblished description of the project's design goals and relevant questions within the contextual inquiry that clearly support this goal.
